            Harry Potter series is a story about a young orphan - Harry Potter- who lives with his maternal aunt and uncle and their son(the dursleys). At the age of 11, Harry gets to know that he is a wizard (his relatives are non-magical people, muggles) and has been offered admission in Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He gets to know that there’s a magical world running parallel to the real world but it is hidden in secrecy.

            The main theme of the series revolves around Death. The book opens with the death of Harry’s parents. Harry after knowing that he is a wizard, also gets to know that he is quite famous in the wizarding world and that there was an evil wizard, Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents and wanted to kill him when he was just one year old baby. There is Voldemort's obsession with conquering death and his quest for immorality at any price, the goal of anyone with magic.Harry is famous because he is the only wizard known to have survived the killing curse.
            
            Each book chronicles one year in Harry's life during the period from 1991 to 1998. Harry makes two best friends at Hogwarts - Ron and Hermione, who are also another main characters of the series. Each year Harry returns back to his relatives (the only living family he has) during summer vacations and rest of the year starting from 1st September spends at Hogwarts. The book is about how Harry deals with dangerous situations each year at Hogwarts with the help of his friends. The situations crop up because of Voldemort’s constant trying of coming back by hook or by crook.
            
            In book 1, the Philosopher’s Stone, Voldemort tries to steal the Philosopher’s stone (the elixir of life) to get his body back. The stone is kept safe by headmaster, Dumbledore, in the Hogwarts itself. Harry and his friends, save the stone in the end, thereby thwarting Voldemort once again and delaying his return.
            
            In book 2, the chamber of secrets, Voldemort tries to use his 16-year old self memory stored in a diary to return back. He uses Ron’s sister, Ginny, this time. Harry gets to know that Voldemort was once a student at Hogwarts, with the name Tom Marvolo Riddle, and he is the heir of famous Salazar Slytherin. In the end, Harry destroys the diary and hence finishing off Voldemort’s another means of returning. He also saves Ginny’s life.
            
            In book 3, the prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a mass murderer and supporter of Lord Voldemort has escaped from Azkaban (wizarding prison). He later gets to know that Sirius Black was his father’s best friend and his godfather. And that he had betrayed his parents by giving their information to Lord Voldemort resulting in Harry’s parents death. In the end, everything gets cleared when Harry meets all three best friends of his father and learns that it was not Sirius but Peter Pettigrew (another one of them) who was the betrayer. Harry reunites with his godfather and saves his life by rescuing him from death punishment.
            
            In book 4, the Goblet of Fire, Lord Voldemort has set up an entire full proof plan for his return. He needs Harry’s blood to complete the spell. He gets successful in trapping Harry this time. He takes Harry’s blood to resurrect. Harry somehow escapes saving his life. He and Dumbledore announces Voldemort’s return but the ministry of magic refuses to believe this.
            
            In book 5, the Order of Pheonix, Dumbledore reassembles his team of trusted wizards to save the wizarding world from Voldemort. There was prophecy made about Harry and Voldemort and hence linking their fate. Voldemort is after that prophecy and leads Harry into a trap at the ministry. A duel takes place between Voldemort’s gang and Dumbledore’s gang leading to Sirius’ death. The ministry finally confirms Voldemort’s return after witnessing him there. Harry hears the prophecy from Dumbledore which says that in the end, Harry and Voldemort will face each other leading to death of one of them.
            
            In book 6, the half-blood prince, Dumbledore starts giving Harry private lessons wherein he shows Harry memories of different people about Voldemort. Harry learns that Voldemort has split his soul into 7 to make himself immortal and in order to finish him, he needs to destroy the objects containing his souls (called horcruxes). By the end of the book, Dumbledore is killed leaving Harry devastated. Harry finally decides to drop the school and move on his journey to kill Voldemort.
            
            In book 7, the deathly hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione start off their journey to find horcruxes. Having no clue about their whereabouts, they are left in despair and hopelessness. But one by one, their fate leads them to all the horcruxes. Harry learns that one is at Hogwarts. They reach Hogwarts and Voldemort declares open war. Harry is able to destroy all the horcruxes and finally confronts Voldemort. Voldemort now mortal once again, is killed by Harry. Later in the epilogue, 36 years later, it is shown that Harry married to Ginny has three kids and Ron married to Hermione has two kids. They send their children to Hogwarts. Harry confirms that nothing has happened in the past 19 years meaning Voldemort was never coming back and all was well.
