    <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (/ˈhɒɡwɔːrts/) is a fictional British boarding school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and serves as a major setting in the Wizarding World universe.[3][4]  </section>

    <p>Hogwarts is a coeducational, secondary boarding school, taking children from ages eleven to seventeen.[4] Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated in the seventh book. Rowling initially said there are about one thousand students at Hogwarts.[6] </section>

        She later suggested around six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with the small number of people in Harry's year. She further explained that this had resulted from her creating only 40 characters for Harry's year.[7]  </div>

        According to the novels, admission to Hogwarts is selective, in that children who show magical ability will automatically gain a place,[8] and squibs cannot attend the school as students (though they can work there in other roles, as Argus Filch does).[9] A magical quill at Hogwarts detects the birth of magical children and writes their names into a large parchment book,[10] but there is no admission test because "you are either magical or you are not."[8] Every year, a teacher checks this book and sends a letter. </div>

        Letters to Muggle-born witches and wizards, who may not be aware of their powers and are unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, are delivered in person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explains to the parents or guardians about magical society, and reassures them regarding this news.[HP7]
